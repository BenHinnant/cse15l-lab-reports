# Remotely Connecting
* Reset password on course-specific account during lab, but the password failed to work; the terminal kept prompting me for the password again until it closed the connection with the server
* Tried resetting my password the next day and it worked after 15 mins

# Trying Some Commands
* Ran several commands on my Windows client and the Linux server to understand their functionality
* I had a Windows computer so Linux commands like ls and cp failed to work

# Moving Files with scp
* Create a file named WhereAmI.java, copy it into the server using scp, access the server using ssh, and run the file using javac and java commands
* The javac command creates the class file that java command runs
* I did not run javac and java on my computer because I haven't downloaded java yet
