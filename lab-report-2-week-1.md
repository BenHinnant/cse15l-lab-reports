# Remotely Connecting
* Reset password on course-specific account during lab, but the password failed to work; the terminal kept prompting me for the password again until it closed the connection with the server
* Tried resetting my password the next day and it worked after 15 mins

# Trying Some Commands
* Ran several commands on the client and server to understand their functionality
* I had a Windows computer so Linux commands like ls and cp failed to work
